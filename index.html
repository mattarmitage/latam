              <h3>Latin America is a continent that is rich in natural resources: oil and gas, metals, and critical minerals. Countries like Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, and Mexico collectively account for nearly one-fifth of global oil reserves; Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile have over half of the world's lithium, and Chile has the world's largest deposits of copper.</h3>
              <p>The continent also boasts a young population, around half under 30. These endowments are both material and substantial when compared to other emerging economies, many of which have opted to establish sovereign wealth funds across a variety of mandates, from managing state financial assets to catalysing inward foreign direct investment (FDI), actively developing specific economic sectors and deepening local markets for both goods and capital.</p>
              <p>The intent of this research<sup><a href="#footnote-1" data-smooth-scroll>1</a></sup> is first to examine the sovereign wealth fund experience as it has evolved in Latin America. We begin with a review of the current landscape. We next review roadblocks and risks – barriers and constraints – to establishing Latin American sovereign funds. Finally, we expand our lens to understand the role that sovereign funds could play in developing stronger and more stable economies in Latin America by expanding development pathways that include reducing poverty and economic inequality, bringing more workers into the formal economy, addressing climate change, and fostering new industries to strengthen sustainable regional growth.<sup>2</sup>

              <h3>It is striking that, in Latin America today, there are 12 sovereign wealth funds, nearly all of which are traditional stabilisation funds, pools of capital that governments can draw on to manage the impacts of volatile fiscal flows (see Figure 1).</h3>
              <p>In other emerging regions, such as Africa, sovereign investment vehicles are much more heterogeneous, as governments have innovated on the traditional sovereign wealth fund models to help drive development in their home economies. According to IFSWF data, there are 18 sovereign wealth funds in Africa, of which 11 have some form of strategic or domestic development mandate, with five having a hybrid mandate, requiring them to fulfil more than one function.</p>
              <p>That is not to say that pure-play stabilisation funds cannot make a valuable contribution to a commodity-rich nation. Stabilisation funds balance fiscal receipts and expenditures, saving in surplus years and paying out when receipts fall under prescribed withdrawal levels. By helping to smooth out commodity revenues, they can help governments avoid extreme peaks and troughs in fiscal cycles. In addition, governments also use stabilisation funds to help manage adverse currency impacts resulting from macroeconomic shocks. Given that their assets might be called upon at short notice, stabilisation funds are usually invested in liquid, low-risk assets and are typically managed by their countries' central banks or finance ministries.

                The COVID-19 crisis effectively highlights the role and recent experience of stabilisation funds in supporting Latin American economies. In Chile,
                for example, where economic activity fell by 5.8% and unemployment rose to more than 10%, the Ministry of Finance withdrew more than $2 billion from Chile's Economic and Social Stabilization Fund (ESSF) to support the national budget. Chile likewise has a Pension Reserve Fund (PRF). During the pandemic, contributions to the PRF were suspended, and the fund was divided into two portfolios to ensure faster and less expensive access to resources under the fund.<sup>3</sup>
              </p>
              <p>
                Among other Latin American sovereign wealth funds, Peru’s Fiscal Stabilization Fund was also used to mute the negative impacts of the fiscal deficit caused by the pandemic. Similarly, Colombia used its stabilisation fund, Fondo de Ahorro y Estabilización (FAEP), to lend up to 80% of its resources to the Fondo de Mitigación de Emergencias (FOME), a fund created by the government to cope with the health and social emergency caused by the pandemic. The FAEP provided about 12.1 billion pesos (about $3 billion) to the FOME, which were used to finance various relief measures, such as providing subsidies, financing health equipment, and extending credit guarantees.<sup>4</sup>
              </p>
              <p>
                Panamá established the Fondo de Ahorro de Panamá (FAP) in 2012 as a stabilisation mechanism in the case of state emergencies or economic slowdowns and to create a long-term savings vehicle for the country. FAP’s funding includes 50% of any contributions from the Panama Canal Authority to Panama’s National Treasury that exceeds 2.25% of nominal GDP for that fiscal year. It also includes earnings of the Fund reinvested until its equity exceeds 5% of the nominal GDP of the previous year. Finally, FAP also receives proceeds from the sale of the shares of Panamanian state-owned enterprises. FAP’s mandate is to preserve its capital beyond unforeseen circumstances that require an emergency withdrawal. FAP anticipates only minimal liquidity needs over a five-year window and, as such, invests with a 5-to-10-year horizon.<sup>5</sup> FAP’s emergency mandate was exercised effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic when it transferred $105 million, or approximately 10% of its assets, to the government for support and relief.<sup>6</sup>

              <p>In Mexico, the Oil Revenues Stabilization Fund (Fondo de Estabilización de los Ingresos Petroleros – FEIP) employs hedging strategies to insulate the local economy from price fluctuations. FEIP manages the funds used for the world’s largest oil hedge, known as “the Hacienda Hedge”, under which the Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público purchases put option contracts (i.e. options to sell oil at a fixed price in the future), as a form of insurance against the risk of a significant decline in the price of oil. While hedging has been successful as a stabilisation strategy for Mexico as an oil exporter, net oil-importing countries in Latin America, typically those without a stabilisation platform, have tended to run deficits when oil prices remain high for extended periods.<sup>7</sup></p>

                In 2013, the Mexican government also established the Mexican Petroleum Fund for Stabilization and Development (Fondo Mexicano del Petróleo para la Estabilización y el Desarrollo, FMPED) to ensure the responsible and transparent management of oil revenues; it became operational in 2015. The fund has three functions: to administer the oil revenues the government receives from Pemex, the national oil company, and other private companies; to manage hydrocarbon exploration and extraction contracts; and finally, to invest a reserve for the long term.8 The long-term reserve, which started operations in 2018, consists of the excess oil revenues remaining after transfers to the federal government up to 4.7% of GDP and net surpluses after cash has been distributed to FEIP and other stabilisation mechanisms.<sup>9</sup> Like other governments in the region, the Mexican government drew on its sovereign wealth fund to cover the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic to the tune of almost 1 billion pesos (c.$60 million) over three years.<sup>10</sup>
              </p>
              <p>
                The newest sovereign wealth funds in Latin America are those established in the micro-states of Guyana and Suriname on Latin America’s Atlantic coast. Both states will benefit from new-found resource wealth with the discovery of oil in 2015 by ExxonMobil in the Stabroek block, an oil field estimated at approximately 11 billion barrels. Oil production is more advanced in Guyana, the larger of the two states with a population of 814,000. To accommodate and sequester an anticipated massive increase in government revenues, the government established the Natural Resource Fund in 2019, amassing a balance of over $2 billion by 2023, currently held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.<sup>11</sup> The objectives of the NRF are to mitigate volatile public spending, ensure against a loss of economic competitiveness, save and transfer natural resource wealth across generations, and finance national development priorities. Thus, in addition to saving, the government has begun to reinvest oil revenues to roll out a national development plan centred on building an inclusive and green economy.<sup>12</sup>
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike Guyana, only a small portion of the Stabroek block is in Suriname’s territorial waters. In September 2023, TotalEnergies announced that it would begin studies to develop a $9 billion oil and gas project at Suriname’s most promising offshore zone.<sup>13</sup> With production lagging that of Guyana, so too has the launch of Suriname’s Savings and Stabilization Fund, the legislation for which was originally passed in 2017. Once operational, subject to prevailing economic conditions,<sup>14</sup> the Fund’s mandate will include stabilising the resources for financing public expenditures, generating an alternative source of revenue, and saving revenues for future generations.

              <h3>Consequently, unlike in other oil-rich regions, such as Norway or the Arabian Gulf, Latin American sovereign wealth funds have not, therefore, been able to evolve from stabilisation to intergenerational savings nor to invest at home to catalyse economic development and diversification. A number of reasons can be conjectured, including scale, political capture, fiscal mismanagement, or social unrest demanding attention to immediate needs.</h3>
              <p>By the mid-twentieth century, economic conditions in the Arabian Gulf were arguably very different to those in most Latin American countries. For example, when oil was discovered in Kuwait and the Trucial States (later to become the United Arab Emirates), these countries had very small populations and economies, enabling the build-up of large fiscal surpluses. Unable to invest excess oil revenues at home, the practical alternative was to recycle oil revenues in international markets such as London, resulting in the creation of what would become the Kuwait Investment Authority and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.</p>
              <p>For the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE), the period between 1997 and 2014 is of particular note. Oil revenues expanded from $200 billion to $800 billion annually, significantly outstripping spending, which rose to about $500 billion over the same period, resulting in savings rates of between 20% and 60%, extending the assets of member sovereign wealth funds by nearly $800 billion.<sup>15</sup> In an interesting turn, more recent procyclical policies, some tied to transformative efforts to diversify the region’s economies, have reversed these trends, leading to increased spending rates and an extended period of fiscal deficits. Notwithstanding, GCC sovereign wealth funds’ balances have continued to increase and supported a substantial increase in government borrowing amid a global environment of lower interest rates.<sup>16</sup>
              </p>
              <p>Conversely, most countries in Latin America have not historically run fiscal surpluses. In the period since 2010, in fact, average deficits in the region have run at approximately 3% of GDP, see Figure 2, extending to nearly 7% during the COVID-19 crisis in 2020 and funded by increased government borrowing.<sup>17</sup> Moreover, even when states have enjoyed sizable resource revenues, governments have been reluctant to strike fiscal balances, frequently opting to run deficits, resulting in widespread macroeconomic instability.<sup>18</sup> In some instances, even when stabilisation funds were created, reserves were drawn down to expand fiscal spending. In this regard, Venezuela proves to be an especially pertinent example.</p>

              <p>The government of Venezuela established the first sovereign wealth fund on the continent in recent history. The Fondo de Inversiones para la Estabilización Macroeconómica (FIEM), in 1999. The purpose of the fund was to smooth out fluctuations in public spending and revenues caused by the volatility of oil prices.<sup>19</sup> The fund also sought to promote fiscal discipline, reduce external debt, and increase international reserves. However, successive reforms of the fund degraded its governance structure, reducing oversight and control by the National Assembly. Consequently, it was often used as a source of discretionary financing by the government, resulting in a massive expansion of the public sector and a crowding out of private enterprise. Consequently, FIEM and its successors failed to prevent the fiscal imbalances and the macroeconomic instability of Venezuela, as the government leveraged its oil revenues to increase national debt to further increase public spending. The fund was depleted in 2013.<sup>20</sup></p>

              <p>This legacy of challenged fiscal and economic management in Latin America, compounded by limited reserves, economic instability, policy sensitivity – and dependence – on political cycles, and institutional capacity constraints, were continuing themes echoed in independent interviews of staff of regional central banks and finance ministries conducted for this study. For example, several interviewees pointed to political and economic stability as critical to successfully managing a sovereign wealth fund. Another stressed the importance of constructing and managing long-term portfolios capable of generating improved risk-adjusted returns.</p>
              <p>Given the lack of fiscal discipline in some countries in the region, it is unsurprising that many Latin American central banks have prioritised safeguarding current assets rather than developing the skills to invest longer term in higher-risk, higher-yielding assets.<sup>21</sup> Even where sovereign wealth funds exist, risk aversion is evident. In the case of Mexico’s FMPED, its founding legislation gives priority to stabilisation over savings, with almost 95% of transfers being allocated to the government’s budget in 2023, <sup>22</sup> while in Chile, the Economic and Social Stabilization Fund and Pension Reserve Fund have been prodded to “consider broader asset classes (including equities or financial instruments linked to real estate) to benefit from higher expected returns and greater diversification”.<sup>23</sup>

              Lastly, accentuating capacity issues, the interviews conducted suggest that the region’s central banks have struggled to recruit and retain talent, significantly limiting their ability to build qualified teams and roll out new reserve management techniques.

In fact, on the horizon, mobilising capital for investment to grow, diversify, and “green” local economies may prove to be a greater and even more intractable challenge, owing to ever-widening regional infrastructure gaps, estimated by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to be over $2.2 trillion across the Latin America and Caribbean region (with nearly 70% in Latin America alone).<sup>24</sup></h3>

              <h3>Targeting water and sanitation (0.52%), electricity (0.81%), transportation (1.37%), and telecommunications (0.41%), the IDB calculates that investments in infrastructure – both new and replaced – will absorb 3.12% of the region’s GDP annually to 2030.25 To close the infrastructure gap, investment at such levels will far exceed the 1.8% annual average of public and private infrastructure investment in the region between 2008 and 2019, potentially accentuating the burden on already challenged fiscal space.26</h3>
              <p>At $152 billion and $58 billion, respectively, in total assets, the IDB and CAF, the Development Bank for Latin America and the Caribbean,27 serve as regional anchors for development finance with common shareholders from among the region’s states. Latin American governments have also exhibited a predisposition to redistribute state revenues through state- owned banks and pension funds rather than amassing reserve balances at the government level.28 In this regard, the IDB reports that National Development Banks (NDBs) in Latin America and the Caribbean have played a central role in addressing the long-term financing requirements of infrastructure projects in the region, second to the private sector and accounting for 20.5% of capital raised between 2004 and 2021.29</p>

              <p>In Colombia, for example, Bancoldex is a state-owned commercial bank that operates as the country’s entrepreneurial development and export-import bank, providing long- and short-term financing and specialised financial products to support Colombian exports and other foreign trade-related activities.30 Similarly, Brazil’s Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES) is a national development bank that provides long-term financing for projects that contribute to the country’s development, such as infrastructure, exports, and social investments.31 In December 2023, Brazil’s government announced efforts to raise $10 billion from multilateral and development banks to fund infrastructure projects to promote integration across Latin America. BNDES is expected to invest approximately $3 billion, the majority of which will fund projects that Brazilian states and municipalities initiate. As of year-end 2023, the federal government, in collaboration with the 11 Brazilian states bordering neighbouring countries, had defined 124 domestic projects as foundational to the scaling and growth of five integration routes in the region.32</p>
