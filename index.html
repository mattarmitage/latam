            <h3>Latin America is a continent that is rich in natural resources: oil and gas, metals, and critical minerals. Countries like Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, and Mexico collectively account for nearly one-fifth of global oil reserves; Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile have over half of the world's lithium, and Chile has the world's largest deposits of copper.</h3>
            <p>The continent also boasts a young population, around half under 30. These endowments are both material and substantial when compared to other emerging economies, many of which have opted to establish sovereign wealth funds across a variety of mandates, from managing state financial assets to catalysing inward foreign direct investment (FDI), actively developing specific economic sectors and deepening local markets for both goods and capital.</p>
            <p>The intent of this research<sup>1</sup> is first to examine the sovereign wealth fund experience as it has evolved in Latin America. We begin with a review of the current landscape. We next review roadblocks and risks – barriers and constraints – to establishing Latin American sovereign funds. Finally, we expand our lens to understand the role that sovereign funds could play in developing stronger and more stable economies in Latin America by expanding development pathways that include reducing poverty and economic inequality, bringing more workers into the formal economy, addressing climate change, and fostering new industries to strengthen sustainable regional growth.<sup>2</sup>

            <h3>It is striking that, in Latin America today, there are 12 sovereign wealth funds, nearly all of which are traditional stabilisation funds, pools of capital that governments can draw on to manage the impacts of volatile fiscal flows (see Figure 1).</h3>
            <p>In other emerging regions, such as Africa, sovereign investment vehicles are much more heterogeneous, as governments have innovated on the traditional sovereign wealth fund models to help drive development in their home economies. According to IFSWF data, there are 18 sovereign wealth funds in Africa, of which 11 have some form of strategic or domestic development mandate, with five having a hybrid mandate, requiring them to fulfil more than one function.</p>
            <p>That is not to say that pure-play stabilisation funds cannot make a valuable contribution to a commodity-rich nation. Stabilisation funds balance fiscal receipts and expenditures, saving in surplus years and paying out when receipts fall under prescribed withdrawal levels. By helping to smooth out commodity revenues, they can help governments avoid extreme peaks and troughs in fiscal cycles. In addition, governments also use stabilisation funds to help manage adverse currency impacts resulting from macroeconomic shocks. Given that their assets might be called upon at short notice, stabilisation funds are usually invested in liquid, low-risk assets and are typically managed by their countries' central banks or finance ministries.

              The COVID-19 crisis effectively highlights the role and recent experience of stabilisation funds in supporting Latin American economies. In Chile,
              for example, where economic activity fell by 5.8% and unemployment rose to more than 10%, the Ministry of Finance withdrew more than $2 billion from Chile's Economic and Social Stabilization Fund (ESSF) to support the national budget. Chile likewise has a Pension Reserve Fund (PRF). During the pandemic, contributions to the PRF were suspended, and the fund was divided into two portfolios to ensure faster and less expensive access to resources under the fund.<sup>3</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
              Among other Latin American sovereign wealth funds, Peru’s Fiscal Stabilization Fund was also used to mute the negative impacts of the fiscal deficit caused by the pandemic. Similarly, Colombia used its stabilisation fund, Fondo de Ahorro y Estabilización (FAEP), to lend up to 80% of its resources to the Fondo de Mitigación de Emergencias (FOME), a fund created by the government to cope with the health and social emergency caused by the pandemic. The FAEP provided about 12.1 billion pesos (about $3 billion) to the FOME, which were used to finance various relief measures, such as providing subsidies, financing health equipment, and extending credit guarantees.<sup>4</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
              Panamá established the Fondo de Ahorro de Panamá (FAP) in 2012 as a stabilisation mechanism in the case of state emergencies or economic slowdowns and to create a long-term savings vehicle for the country. FAP’s funding includes 50% of any contributions from the Panama Canal Authority to Panama’s National Treasury that exceeds 2.25% of nominal GDP for that fiscal year. It also includes earnings of the Fund reinvested until its equity exceeds 5% of the nominal GDP of the previous year. Finally, FAP also receives proceeds from the sale of the shares of Panamanian state-owned enterprises. FAP’s mandate is to preserve its capital beyond unforeseen circumstances that require an emergency withdrawal. FAP anticipates only minimal liquidity needs over a five-year window and, as such, invests with a 5-to-10-year horizon.<sup>5</sup> FAP’s emergency mandate was exercised effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic when it transferred $105 million, or approximately 10% of its assets, to the government for support and relief.<sup>6</sup>

            <p>In Mexico, the Oil Revenues Stabilization Fund (Fondo de Estabilización de los Ingresos Petroleros – FEIP) employs hedging strategies to insulate the local economy from price fluctuations. FEIP manages the funds used for the world’s largest oil hedge, known as “the Hacienda Hedge”, under which the Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público purchases put option contracts (i.e. options to sell oil at a fixed price in the future), as a form of insurance against the risk of a significant decline in the price of oil. While hedging has been successful as a stabilisation strategy for Mexico as an oil exporter, net oil-importing countries in Latin America, typically those without a stabilisation platform, have tended to run deficits when oil prices remain high for extended periods.<sup>7</sup></p>

              In 2013, the Mexican government also established the Mexican Petroleum Fund for Stabilization and Development (Fondo Mexicano del Petróleo para la Estabilización y el Desarrollo, FMPED) to ensure the responsible and transparent management of oil revenues; it became operational in 2015. The fund has three functions: to administer the oil revenues the government receives from Pemex, the national oil company, and other private companies; to manage hydrocarbon exploration and extraction contracts; and finally, to invest a reserve for the long term.8 The long-term reserve, which started operations in 2018, consists of the excess oil revenues remaining after transfers to the federal government up to 4.7% of GDP and net surpluses after cash has been distributed to FEIP and other stabilisation mechanisms.<sup>9</sup> Like other governments in the region, the Mexican government drew on its sovereign wealth fund to cover the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic to the tune of almost 1 billion pesos (c.$60 million) over three years.<sup>10</sup>

              The newest sovereign wealth funds in Latin America are those established in the micro-states of Guyana and Suriname on Latin America’s Atlantic coast. Both states will benefit from new-found resource wealth with the discovery of oil in 2015 by ExxonMobil in the Stabroek block, an oil field estimated at approximately 11 billion barrels. Oil production is more advanced in Guyana, the larger of the two states with a population of 814,000. To accommodate and sequester an anticipated massive increase in government revenues, the government established the Natural Resource Fund in 2019, amassing a balance of over $2 billion by 2023, currently held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.<sup>11</sup> The objectives of the NRF are to mitigate volatile public spending, ensure against a loss of economic competitiveness, save and transfer natural resource wealth across generations, and finance national development priorities. Thus, in addition to saving, the government has begun to reinvest oil revenues to roll out a national development plan centred on building an inclusive and green economy.<sup>12</sup>

              Unlike Guyana, only a small portion of the Stabroek block is in Suriname’s territorial waters. In September 2023, TotalEnergies announced that it would begin studies to develop a $9 billion oil and gas project at Suriname’s most promising offshore zone.<sup>13</sup> With production lagging that of Guyana, so too has the launch of Suriname’s Savings and Stabilization Fund, the legislation for which was originally passed in 2017. Once operational, subject to prevailing economic conditions,<sup>14</sup> the Fund’s mandate will include stabilising the resources for financing public expenditures, generating an alternative source of revenue, and saving revenues for future generations.
